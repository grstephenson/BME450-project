## Project Description
We plan to create a deep learning code that will accept input from the users, in the form of all current medication, and output a detailed schedule of when medication needs to be taken. It will also cross reference the known data on the use of the medication in conjunction with one another to ensure safety. The goal of this project is to increase safety of medication and to provide peace of mind to elderly users who may have a declining memory. We plan to use a dataset from the FDA with information about approved drugs and there uses.
